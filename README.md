# CME-Social-Media-Network
In this exercise we want to design classes for a simple social network. We have users which have a name, an age, a height, a set of hobbies, an entry whether they are male or female, an internal ID and a set of friends.

A user doesn't have to provide all information except the name. The name always has to be provided. (think about how to design this) Our SocialNetwork should provide us with the possibility to add and delete users from the network. It should also allow us to search users by name, age, id or hobbies. 
   
Additionally we want to receive all the friends a particular user has. But we only want to receive the set of ID's of those users (friends). Neither the names of the users have to be unique nor any other attribute. Only the id of every user has to be unique in the whole network.
